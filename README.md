ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Zakaria Elkashef, a seasoned backend developer with a passion for crafting robust digital solutions. With over three years of hands-on experience, I've had the privilege to work on a diverse array of projects spanning e-commerce platforms, blogs, restaurant management systems, car washing services, portfolios, and agency websites.

My expertise extends across various domains, including web application development, website creation, and API design tailored for seamless integration with mobile applications. One of my proudest achievements is the development of a PHP package available on Packagist, specifically designed to expedite project setup using the repository pattern design.

Driven by an unwavering love for coding, I find immense joy in bringing ideas to life through elegant and efficient code. From conceptualization to deployment, I thrive on tackling challenges and delivering high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.

Let's connect and collaborate on building the next generation of innovative digital experiences!
